**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets about the coronavirus to gain insights into public opinions and emotions surrounding the pandemic. By classifying the sentiment of tweets, the project aims to understand the overall sentiment trends and provide valuable information for decision-making, public health, and crisis management.

**Project Features**

Data collection: Gathering a large dataset of tweets related to the coronavirus using the Twitter API.
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the tweet text by removing noise, special characters, and irrelevant information.
Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the preprocessed tweet text, such as word frequency, n-grams, or word embeddings.
Model selection and training: Experimenting with different machine learning or deep learning algorithms for sentiment classification.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Creating visualizations, such as sentiment distribution plots or word clouds, to better understand the sentiment patterns in the dataset.
